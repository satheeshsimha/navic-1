\section{IRNSS Navigation data}
Navigation data in satellite communication refers to the crucial information transmitted between satellites and ground-based receivers to facilitate accurate positioning and navigation. It includes data related to satellite orbits, precise timing, and other parameters necessary for determining the satellite's position relative to the Earth's surface.
\section{Frame structure}
NavIC master frame consists of $2400$ symbols, divided into $4$ subframes. Each subframe is $600$ symbols long. Each subframe has $16$ bit Sync word followed by $584$ bits of interleaved data. Subframes $1$ and $2$ transmit fixed primary navigation parameters. Subframe $3$ and $4$ transmit secondary navigation parameters in the form of messages. The master frame structure is shown in figure \ref{fig:master_frame}.

\label{fig:master_frame}
\end{figure}

\noindent Each subframe is $292$ bits long without FEC encoding and sync word. It starts with TLM word of 8 bits and ends with $24$ bit Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC) followed by $6$ tail bits. In subframes $1$ and $2$ navigation data is allotted with $232$ bits, starting from bit $31$. In subframe $3$ and $4$, $220$ bits are allotted starting from bit $37$. The typical structure of the subframes are shown in figure \ref{fig:frame_1_2} and figure \ref{fig:frame_3_4} respectively.

\section{Encoding}
\subsection{PRN codes for SPS}
PRN Codes selected for Standard Positioning System are similar to GPS C/A Gold codes. The length of each code is $1023$ chips. The code is chipped at $1.023$ Mcps.

\noindent For SPS code generation, the two polynomials G1 and G2 are as defined below:
\begin{align}
G1 &: X^{10}+X^{3} + 1\\
G2 &: X^{10}+X^9+X^8+X^6+X^3+X^2+1
\end{align}
Polynomial G1 and G2 are similar to the ones used by GPS C/A signal. The G1 and G2 generators are realized by using $10$ bits Maximum Length Feedback Shift Registers(MLFSR). The initial state of G2 provides the chip delay. The G1 register is initialized with all bits as $1$. G1 and G2 are XOR'ed for the generation of the final $1023$ chip long PRN sequence. The SPS PRN code generator is shown in figure \ref{figure:codeGen}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\input{figs/spsCode_genBlock.tikz}
	\caption{SPS PRN Code Generator}
	\label{figure:codeGen}
\end{figure}

\noindent The satellites that are used in the current simulation are with PRN ids - $1,3,5$ and $7$. The initial condition of G2 register in L5 and S bands for the given PRN ids is given in table \ref{table:sps_codes}.

\subsection{FEC Encoding}
The Navigation data subframe of $292$ bits is convolution encoded with a rate of 1/2 and clocked at $50$ symbols per second. The coding scheme is given in figure \ref{fig:FEC}. Each subframe of $292$ bits, after encoding, results in $584$ symbols. Various FEC encoding parameters used in NavIC are tabulated in table \ref{table:fec_enc}.

\end{table}
\subsection{Interleaving}
Any burst errors during the data transmission can be corrected by interleaving. In matrix interleaving, input symbols are filled into a matrix column wise and read at the output row wise. This will spread the burst error, if any, during the transmission. For SPS, data is filled into matrix of size $73$ by $8$($73$ columns, $8$ rows).
\subsection{Sync word and Tail bits}
Each subframe has a $16$ bit word synchronization pattern which is not encoded. Sync pattern is $EB90$ Hex. Tail bits consist of $6$ zero value bits added to the subframe and tail bits are part of FEC encoding. 

\subsection{Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC)}
The parity coding of data signal follows $24$Q polynomial for each subframe. $24$ bits of CRC parity will provide protection against burst as well as random errors with undetected error probability of $2^{-24}$ for all channel bit error probabilities $0.5$.
\begin{equation}
    g(X) = \sum_{i = 0}^{24}g_{i}X^i\;\; 
\end{equation}

    $g_{i}=1$; for $i = 0,1,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,14,17,18,23,24$ \\
          = 0 otherwise

\section{Modulation}

\subsection{Standard Positioning Service}
The SPS signal is BPSK(1) modulated on L5 and S bands. The navigation data at data rate of $50$ sps (1/2 rate FEC encoded) is modulo $2$ added to PRN code chipped at $1.023$ Mcps. The CDMA modulated code is upconverted by the L5 and S carriers at $1176.45$ MHz and $2492.028$ MHz respectively. However, this simulation does not carry out this upconversion.

\subsection{Baseband Modulation}
The carrier signal is modulated by BPSK(1), Data channel BOC(5,2), and Pilot Channel BOC(5,2). To have a constant envelop when passed through power amplifier, we add additional signal called interplex signal.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Equations}
The following equations describe baseband signals for L5 and S band navigation data.
\\
\textbf{SPS Data Signal:}
\begin{equation}
	s_{sps}(t) = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} c_{sps}(\abs{i}_{L\_sps}) . d_{sps}(\sbrak{i}_{CD\_sps}) . \rect_{T_{c,sps}}(t-iT_{c,sps})
\end{equation}
\textbf{RS BOC Pilot Signal:}
\begin{equation}
	s_{rs\_p}(t) = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} c_{rs\_p}(\abs{i}_{L\_rs\_p}) . \rect_{Tc,rs\_p}(t-iT_{c,rs\_p}). sc_{rs\_p}(t,0)
\end{equation}
\textbf{RS BOC Signal:}
%\begin{equation}
\begin{multline}
	s_{rs\_d}(t) = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} c_{rs\_d}(\abs{i}_{L\_rs\_d}) . d_{rs\_d}(\sbrak{i}_{CD\_rs\_d}).  \\ 
	                       \rect_{T_{c,rs\_d}}(t-iT_{c,rs\_d}). sc_{rs_d}(t,0)
\end{multline}
%\end{equation}
The sub-carrier is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	sc_x(t,\phi) = \sgn\sbrak{sin(2 \pi f_{sc,x}t + \phi)}
\end{equation}

\noindent The IRNSS RS data and pilot BOC signals are sinBOC. Hence the subcarrier phase $\phi=0$.
The complex envelope of composite signal with Interplex signal (I(t)) is:
\begin{equation}
s(t) = \dfrac{1}{3} \sbrak{\sqrt{2} (s_{sps}(t) + s_{rs\_p}(t)) + j(2. s_{rs\_d}(t) - I(t))} 
\end{equation}

\noindent The Interplex signal $I(t)$ is generated to realize the constant envelope composite signal. The operation $\abs{i}_X$ gives the code chip index for any signal. Similarly $[i]_X$ gives data bit index for any signal.
