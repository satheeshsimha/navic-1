L1 directory contains code for Python simulations for Navic L1 receiver.
This has 3 componetns:
a) L1/codes/e2esim : This directory contains both Transmitter and receiver code. Here, receiver processes transmitter simulated data. Transmitter sends random NAV bits andreceiver ensures proper reception
b) L1/codes/satelliet_signal: Here the receiver processes L1 signals received directly from satellite.
c) L1/codes/sample_data : Here the receiver processes L1 samples received from ISRO.
